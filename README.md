## Usage
The application prompts for a list of addresses at launch. The format it expects is as follows;
```
Name \t Identifier \t Address \t Zip
```

Use the next and previous buttons to browse through the possible zip codes for the supplied addresses. Zip4 codes are automatically copied to the clipboard when the address is visited.
